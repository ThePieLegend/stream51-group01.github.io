        <p>VR in mental health therapy is most commonly used to treat anxiety disorders such as phobias, social anxiety and post traumatic stress disorders, and the treatment supported by VR technology is exposure therapy. Exposure therapy is a treatment in which patients confront stimuli that brings them fear.  Modern exposure therapy is based on emotional theory which states that “fear memories are structures that contain information regarding fear stimuli, responses, and meaning” (Maples-Keller et al., 2017, p. 2). Figure 5 shows a diagram of emotional processing theory, and it illustrates why VR based techniques make an ideal method of facilitating exposure therapy (Maples-Keller et al., 2017). </></p>
       
		<p>The process of treatment activates a patient’s fear structure, where the patient accompanied by a therapy investigates the response and discusses coping strategies (Maples-Keller et al., 2017). These strategies can then be practised and experimented within the virtual realm. Maples-Keller et al. (2017), proposes that the treatment course be 2-3 initial sessions for the therapist to examine the patient’s psychosocial history and educate the patient on the process. When progressing through the treatment, the progress should be an ongoing discussion between the therapist and patient, and the amount of treatments are based on the pace moving through the exposure hierarchy (Maples-Keller et al., 2017). Figure 7 illustrates the process of exposure therapy, even though it specificies PTSD, the same concept can be applied to most anxiety disorders.</></p>

            <p>It is important to note that this whole process is accompanied by a professional, and effective treatment is highly unlikely without a trained professional. Maples-Keller et al. (2017) stresses that “bad VR therapy is still just bad therapy” (p.13). Historically, exposure therapy has been administered through in vivo exposure (patient confronts stimulus in actuality), or imaginal therapy (patient confronts stimulus in in imagination), and these interventions have significant weaknesses that can be overcome by VR intervention (Maples-Keller et al., 2017). One such is the difficulty of arranging in vivo exposure for patients. Arranging in vivo exposures can at times be extremely costly, logistically impractical, and on top of that potentially dangerous (Boeldt et al., 2019). One example is bringing a soldier into a warzone for treatment. These weaknesses are eliminated with the use of VR due to the fact that VR equipment is getting cheaper, and as all scenarios are simulated, there are very little logistical and safety issues involved.  An added bonus is that the simulation can be created down to the very last detail with modern technology making the whole process a simulation for all five senses. Imaginal exposure has four key weaknesses. The first is the fact that not every patient can imagine well, and secondly the ability to form mental images can decline with age. Thirdly, the patient's imagery can be frightening, and finally, the therapist cannot control or know what is being imagined (Boeld et al., 2019). Figure 8 illustrates the process of imaginal exposure in the best case scenario, and also shows the potential weaknesses. All of these weaknesses are solved by the introduction of VR, as it eliminates the patient’s need to imagine and form mental images. Furthermore, due to the nature of how VR is generated and projected the final two weaknesses are also solved</p>

        <p>The biggest advantage of using VR in mental health therapy is that it gives clinicians the ability to witness and control the entire situation, thus making it an invaluable aspect in treatment. The use of VR in mental health therapy has shown promising results in the treatment of specific phobias and PTSD (Maples-Keller et al., 2017 ; Rizzo et al., 2019; Rizzo et al., 2010). In a study completed in 2001, on the use of VR therapy through the Virtual Vietnam program on Vietnam War veterans, the result saw “a 34% decrease in clinician-rated symptoms of PTSD and a 45% decrease on self-reported symptoms of PTSD” (Rizzo, et al., 2019, p. 59). Maples-Keller et al. (2017), discusses the effectiveness of VR exposure therapy within many different kinds of anxiety disorders, and notes that results can be seen after a single session.</p>

        </div>

        <p>A large disadvantage for mental health therapy is the dropout rate within therapy. Decreasing dropout rates are crucial for mental health therapy since only very few people with mental health illnesses actually seek out care for their illness. Rizzo et al. (2019) mentions that only around 23%-43% of veterans whose results were positive for mental health disorders sought out treatment, and only half completed the course of treatment. They also mentioned that “those whose responses were positive for a mental disorder were twice as likely as those whose responses were negative to report concern about possible stigmatization and other barriers to seeking mental health care” (Rizzo et al., 2019, p.242).</p>

        <p>VR has the ability to make an impact to make a difference on this disadvantage, due to the fact that the current demographic are more comfortable and attracted to this novel technology (Rizzo et al., 2019). This means that it will be more likely for people to seek out treatment out of curiosity, and alongside the development of over-the-counter VR therapy software more people can recieve treatment for minor anxiety disorders before they escalate to a clinical level. This is supported in a study conducted by Rimer et al. (2021), who found that drop out rates in VR treatments were lower compared to conventional therapy.</p>
