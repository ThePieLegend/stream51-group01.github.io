		<p>Virtual reality (VR) creates a computer-generated world where users can receive sensory feedback via technological devices. These devices could be a head-mounted device, flat screen and a projection system. However in more complex systems users are able to interact with the environment (Mekbib et al., 2020). From a technological standpoint, VR encompases all technological components that “provide[s] interactions between a user and an artificially generated environment” (Fromberger et al., 2018, p. 236).</p>

		<p>There are two main classifications of VR systems used in therapy - one is called a Commercial Video Gaming Console (CVGC), and two is a Custom Built Virtual Environment (CBVE) (Mekbib et al., 2020).</p>

		<p>CVGC, are off-the-shelf consoles such as Nintendo Wii and XBox Kinect, these are designed for recreation and are often easy-to-use, inexpensive and readily available. These are not generally suited for therapy, especially in rehabilitation as they are designed for healthy people (Mekbib et al., 2020).</p>

		<p>These interfaces</p>

		<p>CBVE, are usually designed with clinicians and researchers, with patients in mind. These machines usually will have automatic data recording systems to track patient data throughout usage. This technology allows physicians to control the virtual environment precisely to patient needs, and deliver stimulants precisely (Mekbib et al., 2020).</p>

		</div>

		<p>Before these two interfaces were invented and are able to be used today. Several key inventions began in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1957, Morton Heilig had invented a system that allowed the user to engage all of their senses with the use of specific components like smell generators and vibrating chairs to complete the multi-sensory experience. The system that was invented was called the Sensorama. Not too long after that in 1961, Philco Corporation built Headsight, a head-mounted display to assimilate motion tracking and dual monitor displays mainly used for military training purposes. Then in 1965, Ivan Sutherland invented the Ultimate Displays, which was the first computer-generated interface that allowed that user to have a greater real time interaction with VR. Eventually the concept of VR was established in 1989 when Jaron Lanier stamped the term “virtual reality”; since then VR had gained a greater presence in research and psychiatric treatment ( Maples-Keller et al., 2017). During the early 1990s, VR systems had suffered from an imbalance “expectation to delivery” ratio, this was because computers were too slow, three-dimensional graphics were still in the early stages, and awkward user-interfaces. Also the head-mounted displays costed too much, was bulky to use and the resolution, field of view, and tracking speed were limited. This caused the public to view VR as a failed technology in 1995 and this period was then call the “nuclear winter”. </p>

		<p>Since the 1990s, scientific literature has evolved significantly, reporting that VR has many positive results across a variety of clinical applications. The areas where VR has been applied useful for clinical use includes fear reduction, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and paranoid delusions (Albert et al., 2019).</p>
