	<h1>Technology Risks</h1>

	<div>
		<p>While exposure therapy is considered effective, there have been noted barriers as to why it is not widely administered yet. The first barrier is the patient’s own fear in exposure therapy, as the process requires patients to confront their feared stimuli - a situation that is considered terrifying in the long term (Boeldt et al., 2019). This brings us to the second barrier, clinicians’ attitudes towards exposure therapy. Clinicians widely believe that the exposure of stimuli can be distressing for both patients and clinicians, with some clinicians believing that this treatment can be considered unethical (Boeldt et al., 2019; Rimer et al., 2021). These two barriers are the likely reason for the high dropout rate for exposure therapy, which according to Imel et al. (2013) can be as high as 41% (Boeldt et al., 2019). In addition there are concerns that exposure therapy can increase risks of aggravating symptoms and therefore worsen the patient’s current conditions (Boeldt et al., 2019).</p>

		<p>The third barrier of exposure therapy is the lack of physicians trained in delivering exposure therapy (Boeldt et al., 2019). It is important to note that the lack of clinicians available to administer exposure therapy indicates that there are even less clinicians able to deliver VR exposure therapy. The reason for this is that therapists are required to be able to deliver exposure therapy before being able to deliver it through VR (Boeldt et al., 2019). Boeldt et al. (2019) further alludes to the fact that clinical skills are crucial to the delivery of treatment.</p>

			<p>Even though VR equipment can be considered relatively affordable with the recent advancements in technology, we can predict further price decrease as patient demand increases (Boeldt et al., 2019). It is also important to keep in mind that the growing market can make it difficult to decide which technologies to utilize (Boeldt et al., 2019). Maples-Keller et al. (2017), points out that equipment usually incurs a large initial cost, and not to mention technological glitches alongside a lack of technological training for clinicians - a sentiment also echoed by Fromberger et al. (2013).</p>
		</div>

		<p>There is ultimately a lack of research conducted on the use of VR in therapy in a clinical setting. Most research conducted on the effectiveness of VR in therapy has the tendency to focus on the outcome rather than the process (Maples-Keller et al., 2017).</p>

		<p>Rimer et al. (2021) has also alluded to the fact that there has been no evidence that recent VR technologies with better technology lead to more successful clinical results. This implies that there is not enough knowledge on what is effective within the methodology of VR in therapy. Maples-Keller et al. (2017) shares a similar sentiment as in their research they have found that there is a lack of standardization in treatments across different phobias alongside the fact that VR is usually only one part of a multifaceted treatment schedule. This means that we need more studies where VR therapy is alienated (Maples-Keller et al., 2019). Rizzo et al. (2010) points out that there is a lack of diversity in the demographic within PTSD exposure therapy studies, which unfortunately makes the results hard to scale for the population.</p>

		<p>The additional amount of research required in order to introduce VR into clinical settings is extensive, and as it is still novel the ethical implications are yet to be fully understood. Therefore, this will mean that with the emerging VR market, the lack of rules, standards and knowledge can lead to grounds of exploitation. Rizzo et al. (2019) notes that in the market analysis of VR in 2025 by Goldman-Sachs healthcare comes in second for market share, with interests of clinical VR by therapists increasing. This implies that there are large economic opportunities that can be exploited if there are no regulations in place. Moreover, at this point much of the research conducted in the realm of VR therapy is funded by companies wanting to push products into the market making there an obvious conflict of interest. </p>
